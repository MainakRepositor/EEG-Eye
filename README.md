### Air Quality Detector (AQID)
![home](https://github.com/MainakRepositor/AQID/assets/64016811/9c162379-72f5-4c95-83f2-d13537f0a883)


### Problem : 

An air quality index or AQI is used by government agencies to communicate to the public how polluted the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. Public health risks increase as the AQI rises. Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standards. 
The purpose of the AQI is to help people know how the local air quality impacts their health.

The application is named AQID which is an Arabic word that means "One who promises". The application not only detects the air quality but at the same time also promises to keep you safe as far as possible.

### Solution:

This Web app will help you to detects a AQI level by analysing the values of several features using the Random Forest Classifier.
